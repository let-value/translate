Start here → /docs/BASE.md
Project add-on → /docs/STACK.md

Quickstart (5 lines):

1) SOLVE: minimal correct change, unit tests only.
2) HARDEN: integration/E2E, coverage gates, observability, security.
3) POLISH: refactor-only PRs, names/boundaries, dead-code removal.
4) Use PR template from BASE.md §10.1.
5) If unsure: open a tiny ADR.

See /docs/BASE.md for the full checklist & playbooks.
